/*Q4. Min-Max via Reference Parameters
Write a C++ function:
void findMinMax(int a, int b, int c, int &minVal, int &maxVal); 
The function must find the minimum and maximum of three integers without using any library function 
and store the results into minVal and maxVal through reference parameters.
In main(), declare two variables int lo, hi, pass them to findMinMax, and print the results. 
Verify that the original variables lo and hi are updated after the call.*/
